            <h2>Start of the Journey</h2>
            <p>
                <p>To begin with, I would like to state a fact, that is: I have had prior experience with HTML. (Yet still struggle to memory all the new stuff going on in this course, XD) </p>
                <p>At the time, it was just thoughts, that maybe it would be interesting to have a website fully created on my own. But when I start doing it I found all the limitations, and the fact that I cannot replicate a good looking and interactive site alike any of those good ones. It is not until this COMP1710 opens a new world for me, by not only taught me how to construct good looking site with those limited functionalities in HTML, but also introduced me the other relevant staff like JSON and third party embedded plugins, and how I should find those good stuffs myself online.</p>
                <p>You can see my first site <a href="https://suoweihu.github.io/WebUtilities/">here</a>. (It’s unfortunate that some text is in Chinese, but the basic idea of the website is a &quot;useful resources collection&quot;, and I am still adding more links till this day). It is really scruffy, and doesn’t really have much carefully thought CSS applied to it. </p>            
            </p>  
            <br>

            <h2>Mistake for Me to Reflect</h2>
            <p>
                <p>There’s a lot of stuff I could have done to improve my site if I would’ve know it earlier. One of the most fatal ones is that I did not fully understand the meaning behind the HTML label’s attributes and CSS style tags. Taking &quot;img&quot; tag for example, I did not know the attribute &quot;alter&quot; is for the screen-reader by those disabled, and for the majority of the image I did not use proper alter text (many are just file name). Another example is the &quot;centering&quot;, when I try to set element to the center, I was using margin and padding, which is both hard to write for the first time and hard to change to adapt changes (now they are all changed to using &quot;align&quot;)</p>
                <p>Another one that I regret till this day is that I didn’t managed to implement varies interaction. Taking the buttons for example, for the majority of them, I only tried using change in opacity and color while hover, I really can do more, like the top three buttons in <a href="https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/ER-diagram-symbols-and-meaning#discovery__top">this site</a>. Or implement using the Bootstarp Framework, which allows the same site to be viewed with proper layout on different platfrom (If i would've know it ealier i could have implemented my site for differeent devices with ease)</p>
            </p>
            <br>

            <h2>Besides HTML and CSS</h2>
            <p>
                <p>In COMP1710 the majority of the part I enjoyed is actually not the HTML (of course they matter, but I think you may regard this as bases for us), rather following section caught me the most:</p>
                <p>&quot;Human Computer Interaction&quot;: the readabilities of text, the interactions like the opacity change when hover , … What kind of element should you built in for the most intuitive, practical, fluent user experience, and Why. I believe this knowledge will not be limited to the web, and I actually I did used a bunch of the concept in one of my other course, which involves Android APP development.</p>
                <p>&quot;Report Writing&quot;: as a second language user to English, I always found my ability of expressing stuff &quot;chained&quot; by the my writing and reading skills, this course taught me lots of tips I could use to improve it. (like transition word, TFFF etc)</p>
