            <h2>What is your first impression of the keyboard ?</h2>
            <blockquote>
            <p>If you are one of the curious person who likes the wander around the back shelf in EB-Game or JB-HiFI’s Game shelves, you might have noticed some gaming gears that seems well over prized, for any morons, and among those, one of these most expensive accessories is: The mechanical keyboard. Well bayside some of them are fake (rubber dome), the rest of them can provide you with either faster activation and re-activation time, or just better typing feelings.</p>
            <br>

            <h2>To know better about this topic, here’s the history of the keyboard</h2>
            <blockquote>
            <ul>
                <li>1868 The type writer come to this world, well they are no computer keyboard, but they defines the base stones of the ascetics, and looks or the modern keyboard, alone with the QWERTY keyboard layout.</li>
                <li>1948 Basic computer invented </li>
                <li>1964 GUI terminal interface</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It is not until 1970, the invention very first electro mechanical keyboard by Alps, a company that would later go on to make all the Apples keyboards. Each switch is made of two reeds made of metal and a moving magnet, when you press a key, you push down the magnet, the contraction causes reeds to touch, and a keypress.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>1974 First Keyboards built into personal computer </li>
                <li>1978 Keyboards start to sell with computers</li>
            </ul>
            <p>And then yet another milestone comes (I would put them in braces), starting from January 1990, membrane switches starting to replace the mechanical switches, they are much cheaper to make and comes in much lighter weight. Unfortunately, due to the characteristic of plastic, the lifespan and quality of these membrane keyboard are compromised. Not to mention the traditional aesthetics look (in my opinion). So it was like the old decade where all smart phone looks different, ends with the announcement of those touch screeen sandwich designed phone by Apple. </p>

            <h2>Then what ?</h2>
            <blockquote>
            <p>It it not until the 21st that this mechanical keyboard renaissance come into our sight: alone with the development of the games and so called E-Sports,people starting to realise that using mechanical keyboard has shorter “bounce back time” and thus leads to more stable gaming performance (or it could be just a commercial fraud idk). Cherry, one of the German computer peripheral device maker, invented and announced their cherry mx switches in 1985, including cherry mx red, mx black, mx blue, each with different tactile feeling and actuation force become popular. (Nothing that there is actually Cherry red/ black and blue, what differs them from the mx series is the the numbers of switch pins, providing more stable presses) </p>
            <p>The market realized this growing business so other companies also started to build similar switches, wishing they could duplicate the success of cherry. There&#39;s more experienced companies including HHKB, funded by professor Eiiti Wada from Tokyo University in Japan, their rubber dome switch keyboard are now known for programmer friendly, due to their silence and layout. And new comers such as Kailh, Gateron Logitech and Razer, some mocks the good old cherry switches and do some minor changes, some invents whole new switches (Romer-G Mechanical switches by Logitech or Optical switches by Razer)</p>
