                My name is Suowei Hu, and you can call me Simon , I am a 2nd year student studying the 
                Software Engineering Undergraduate Degree under college of ANU. 
                <br><br>
                I am from Hangzhou district of China’s Zhejiang province, which is one of China’s economic 
                and cultural centers, and is also well known for its natural beauty. 
                I have been in Australia for a total of 3 years now, I studied my 10th grade in Stromlo High 
                School, 11 - 12 in Narrabundah College. 
                <br><br>
                To me personally, Australian is a magical land where 
                people from different countries and cultural background get alone well, and helping out each 
                other with what they are good at. Hopefully one day when I finish my study, I may pay back to 
                this community.

                "Me and my passion" is an online semi-resume site introducing myself, my career and my passions,    
                to demonstrate my ability to properly use web programming and web designing skills,  and could also 
                be potentially used as a brief scratch for latter blogging.  Unlike competing site, (site from some 
                of my course pals?)  I’ll try to research and integrate more advanced features (flashy features) , 
                and that includes using some other multi-media tools such as Photoshop.
