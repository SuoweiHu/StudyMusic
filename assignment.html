<h1><b> My assignment.html page for linking to assignment items described in Assignment and Report Specifications</b></h1>
<p><br></p>
<p>This page is the marking guide to your website that your tutor will use to find your elements.  Do not name this page anything other than assignment.html (all lower case) or else we may not be able to find and mark your assignment elements.<span>&nbsp; </span>How to use this page:</p>
<ul>
  <li>upload this assignment.html file in your website directory during part 2.3 of Lab 1</li>
  <li>later, link this page to your website's index.html page</li>
  <li>over time, link each assignment task listed below to its location in your website as soon as you have started it</li>
  <li>replace the "notes" paragraph with your notes or
delete if you have no notes - your notes will help us understand and
mark your site so you should explain things. Maybe you did a task
differently from the way we specified it, either because your way is
better (tell us) or minimally or not at all to fit in with your site's
look and feel (tell us) or ... (also tell us). So, for example, a video
might spoil the look and feel. What you do is make one anyway, link to
it from this assessment.html page and explain in the <i>Notes</i> why
it's not linked to from your public version of your web site. You can
style this page as your like, so long as you keep the links to the
assignment tasks.</li>
  <li>provide details for your best student forums posts where indicated</li>
  <li>provide the date you attended the continuous improvement session where indicated</li>
  <li>provide link to report where indicated</li>
  <li>delete these instructions when you are ready</li>
</ul>

  Assignment Planning: <a href="src/pages/me_and_my_passion.html#planning">Link</a> <br> 
  <br>
  Notes: <br>
  <ul>
    <li>I also include a website that shows some images of my custom build keybord: <a href="src/pages/keyboard_gallary.html">Image Gallary</a></li>
    <li>I did not use the "fixed position menu" introduced in mooc 5, because it does not seem fitting my styling very well.</li>
    <li>The "blockquote" css styling are inspired by the sspai website, I have included the reference in the source log page.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2><b>1.3 CSS</b></h2>
<p>
  CSS: <a href="src/css/default.css">Link</a> <br> <br>
  Note: <br>
  <ul>
    <li>I only have one CSS "default.css" for now, but I may add more later in the following assignemnt parts.</li>
    <li>As mentioned previsouly, "blockquote" css styling are partially from sspi</li>

<h2><b>1.6 Feedback Form</b></h2>
<p>Feedback Form: <a href="src/pages/feedback_form.html">Link</a></p>
<p> 
  Note: <br>
  <ul>
    <li>
      I have also designed a “Heads up” section to express my thank towards those willing to finish the form, <br>
      hoping this will give more sence of interaction between me and my user, encouraging them to give feedback. <br><br>
    </li>
    <li>
      Since we have not learn how to submit the form using the php (learnt form using email), but uploading form using php have more resources on the internet. <br>
      I have implmented the forms for both approach (email and php), with email's form is fully functional, and php's form having attribute: action="feedback_form.php". <br>
      I have not finished the "feedback_form.php", so the feedback form using php is not function right now, they are just for look. I may come back if I have the compotent<br>
      knowlegde to finish it, but for now, I just wanna demonstrate a better way i think of to design the feedback form. <br><br>

<h1><b>2.0 Part 2 Tasks</b></h1>
<h2><b>2.1 Image Map</b></h2>
<p>Image Map: <a href="src/pages/keyboard_switches.html">Link</a></p>
<p>
  Notes: 
  <ul>
    <li>I only implemented the very basic labeling method (all i did was title="mouse_hover_text")</li>
    <li>
      I've heard of that according the marking scheme, the <strong>Use external links will be demirited</strong>. However due to the nature of my context, that is: <strong>Show viewers the very detailed<br> 
      paramter and feature of every individual switch they found intersted</strong>. To archieve that, I need to implement 20+ image map links). I found it quite challenging to make all the links<br>
      as local pages. I hope you you could tolerate me for using all those external links, but I also respect your choice if you decides it is more fair to remove marks for this. <br>
    </li>
    <li>The ImageMap Generator, Images used in this section are included into the <a href="src/pages/source_log.html">Source Log</a>.</li>

  </p>
<p>Notes: 
  <ul>
    <li>
      I reached out through social media, and granted permission to use <a href="https://kbdfans.com/">KBDFans</a> photo (for education purpose here only) <br>
      So here to express my greatfulness towards them, I created this little "<a href="src/pages/kbdfans_gallary.html">Keyboard Store</a>", where all the images links to their shopping site.

<h2><b>2.3 &amp; 2.4 Storyboard + Video / <strike>Javascript</strike> </b></h2>
<p>I am doing <strong>storyboard/video</strong> for this section.</p>

<h2><b>2.3 Storyboard for Video /<strike>Javascript addition</strike></b></h2>

<h2><b>2.4 Video / <strike>Well written Javascript</strike></b></h2>
<p>
  <li>Video: <a href="src/pages/video.html">Link</a></li>
</p>
<p>Notes:
  <ul>
    <li>
      I initially planned to make one video (with two part: historical milestone, and my showoff). But after second thought, I have no good transition words to say for the two part, <br>
      the context is better to be seperated and with proper labelling. I'm sorry if this inconvinience you, but I have two videos ("<a href="src/pages/video.html#keyboard-history">Keyboard Histroy</a>", and "<a href="src/pages/video.html#so-what-do-I-have">So what do I have?</a>").
    </li>
    <li>
      I've heard some student has issue playing the video (keep buffering), and I expect you will encounter similar issue, so I've compressed the video a little such that it will load faster. <br>(Quality is compromised a little, hope you wont mind)
    </li>
    <li>If you cannot load the video, or load takes a long timem, lost your patien. I have also made a <a href="src/pages/video.html#video-back-up">Backup</a> for you on Youtube.</li>
    <li>
      All the external Images, Videos used in this section are included into the <a href="src/pages/source_log.html">Source Log</a> .

<h1><b>3.0 Part 3 Tasks</b></h1>

<h2><b>3.1 Reflections</b></h2>
<p>Please see About-My-Site page: <a href="src/pages/above_my_site.html">here</a></p>


<h2><b>3.2 Alternative CSS</b></h2>
<p>You can see the <strong>raw</strong> print-friendly CSS file: <a href="src/css/default.css">here</a></p>
<p>Notes: <br>


  <p>The alternative CSS I did in this part is a Print-Friendly format, the new created <a href="src/css/printout.css"> Print-Friendly CSS</a> is actually just a couple of lines taken and <br>
     modified from the original <a href="src/css/default.css">Default CSS</a>. I only implemented this CSS into some of the pages (see below), this is because: the images I used<br>
     in many of the non-text based pages (including image gallery) are not in a uniform size;my earlier implementation of them also involves a lot of  <br> 
     float and sectioning, which turns out to cause a lot of trouble when I tries to to alter then for printing. To view the effect of the Print-Friendly <br>
     CSS file, you can use <strong>&quot; Command+P&quot;</strong> or <strong>&quot;Ctrl+P&quot;</strong> on your browser to enter the print, to either inspect or printout the page.
  </p>

  
  <p> You may use anyone of the pages below to see the outcome:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><a href="src/pages/storyboard_script.html"> STORY BOARD - SCRIPTED VR. </a></li>

    <li><a href="src/pages/me_and_my_passion.html">ME AND MY PASSION</a></li>
  </ul>
</p>



<h2><b>3.3 Social Networking Button(s)</b></h2>
<p>Example: bottom of the page "<a href="src/pages/me_and_my_passion.html"> Me and My Passion</a>"</p>
<p>Notes: <br>
I have put the social media button at most of the site where a typical user may be intersted to find me. <br>
And this include most of the text based pages, but none of the "image-gallary" like pages (In my opinion, the bulky   <br>
button kind of interrupted the reader's flow of enjoying the photos; He/she might wanna poke around  <br>
at those button, and find him lost on my stupid profile. or awkward personal bio) <br>
</p>

<h2><b>3.4 Social Networking Feed(s)</b></h2>
<p>Please see: <a href="src/pages/keyboard_news.html">this page</a></p>
<p>Notes: <br> 
  I did not use any third party feeds platform to do the staff here. (as many of them are paid service or free-tial <br>
  but requires you to enter your credit card info, OAO) All i did here is to retrieve the embeded code for pulgin  <br>
  from Facebook, and did some minor changes to its framing (mostly margin and width) so they line-up and look ok.
</p>

<h2><b>3.5 CSS and HTML Validation</b></h2>
<p>Please see: <a href="src/pages/page_validation.html">this page</a></p>
<p>Note: <br>
  I run my validation using "raw input" just for that you may see which screenshot corresponds to which file <br>
  (Sicne validate via file uploading or direct link only show the suceessful or not), you can <strong>click on the</strong> <br>
  <strong>image</strong> to go to the site (html flie) or style sheet (css file) of that image's coreesponding.
</p>

<h2><b>3.6 Something Original</b></h2>
<p>Please see: 
  <ul>
    <li>
      ePub: <a href="src/pages/me_and_my_passion.html">this page</a> (bottom of page: download EPUB version)
    </li>
    <li>
      search box: <a href="src/pages/kbdfans_gallary.html">this page</a> (Search Box in Find at KBDFans section)
    </li>
    <li>
      original content: <a href="src/pages/keyboard_switches.html">this page</a> (some original writting)
    </li>
  </ul>

</p>

<p>Notes: <br>
  <ul>
    <li>
      ePub: I followed the lecture's guide and made a epub version of my "me-and-my-passion" page, exported the page <br>
      to html (before exporting the html file i did some minor modification such as removing the top link bar and botton <br>
      share button etc), then using the Calibre software to convert the page to epub format, and added the required <br>
      image resources such that the image displays properly... (You may also dowmload the epub file directly from: <a href="src/epub/Me and My Passion - Suowei Hu.epub">here</a> ) <br>
      <br>
      </li>
      <li>
        Search Box: I also built this little feature for user to search at the KBDFan's store, this is for such <br>
        that if users find something they are intersted and wanna look deeper they can search with it.  <br>
        It was built using the functionality of HTML element of form (so i didn't use javascript whatever). <br>
        When click submit, it brings the user the the KBDFan's search page with the proper setup query. <br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>
        Original Content: I have these writting about different switches, why they matter, <br>
        and how they differs etc. Which hopefully could help one decide which switch to pick <br>
        when starting his jouney in the mechanical keybord. <br>
      </li>
  </ul>
